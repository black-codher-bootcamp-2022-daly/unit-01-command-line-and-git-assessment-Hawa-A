My Name:

Hawa Abdallah


Bio, Education, and Interests: 

My name is Hawa, I am a very multi-faceted individual. I enjoy taking on new challenges and learning! I am neuro-diverse and whilst this can provide challenges due to my learning style, I do not allow it to define me, hinder me or prevent me from achieving. I love to expand my skill set and I am always open to picking up new skills to add to my repertoire. I am on track to being a Full-Stack Developer and the Black Codher Bootcamp is my stepping stone towards achieving this. I am super grateful to be part of this and part of the fantastic Daly Cohort. I have a BA Joint Hons in American Studies and English, so whilst my degree isnâ€™t STEM based my interests led me to pursue Full Stack Development.
