# **Hawa Abdallah**


## **Bio** 

*My name is Hawa, I am a very multi-faceted individual. I enjoy taking on new challenges and learning! I am neuro-diverse and whilst this can provide challenges due to my learning style, I do not allow it to define me, hinder me or prevent me from achieving. I love to expand my skill set and I am always open to picking up new skills to add to my repertoire. I am on track to being a Full-Stack Developer and the Black Codher Bootcamp is my stepping stone towards achieving this. I am super grateful to be part of this and part of the fantastic Daly Cohort.* 


## **Education** 

*I have a BA Joint Hons in American Studies and English, so whilst my degree isnâ€™t STEM based my interests led me to pursue Full Stack Development.*


## **Interests:** 

I love tech and keeping my finger on the pulse of new advancements. However, aside from tech and in particular coding, I'm super creative and I'm a lover of the arts! I enjoy checking out art exhibitions and I enjoy creating art myself (this is what led me to make-up artistry https://www.instagram.com/facesbyhawa/). I also enjoy baking and I am my family's designted birthday cake maker.
